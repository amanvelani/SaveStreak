# SaveStreak Server

## Description

The SaveStreak server is responsible for handling all incoming requests from the SaveStreak frontend and interacting with the Plaid API to retrieve financial data. It securely stores this data in a database for further processing and analysis.

The server will be  built using the Go programming language, which provides a robust and efficient framework for developing high-performance servers. It leverages the Plaid API to establish secure connections with financial institutions and retrieve account balances, transaction history, and other relevant financial data.

By using the SaveStreak server, users can securely link their bank accounts, view their financial information, and track their savings progress over time. The server ensures the privacy and security of user data by implementing industry-standard encryption and authentication mechanisms.
